My friend needed to send me hundreds of GBs of RAW photos from a recent trip and didn't want to pay for cloud hosting.

What followed was a very fun day of my first real GO project that had a real usecase and made us both very happy!

Run:
1. Generate exe for server and client
2. Update config
3. Run server
4. Create a directory within the clients photograph folder and put the client exe + config inside
5. Run the client
6. Watch as 10 workers begin pumping photographs to the other side of the world.
